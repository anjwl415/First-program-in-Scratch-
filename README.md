# First-program-in-Scratch-
My first submission for the CS50 course. 

## I had to make a script that contained:
  - At least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
  - At least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
  - At least one condition.
  - At least one loop.
  - At least one variable.
  - At least one sound.
  - The project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
